                        the road section) constitute the <span class="color-orange">hidden states</span>. The continuation of most likely hidden states (the route followed on the network) is

                        difference computed over the 400,000 points is not overly pronounced (7.1m against 8.6m). We also contextualized these values ​​by comparing them with the indicated planimetric
                        precision by Android, keeping in mind the imprecision of this urban information. Thus, 65.4% of the orthogonally projected points are located in their precision radius, against
                        55.7% when using Markov chains.

                        ensures the continuity of the trace on the network. In one case out of a thousand, the naive algorithm indeed projects a points out of the pedestiran graph, which is not not
                        connected the previous points. In addition, we calculated the path length between two consecutive projected points. The averages obtained are respectively 9.3m and 6.8m for the
                        naive and HMM based algorithms.

                        Our first results tend to validate the use of a Map Matching algorithm, in this case the one based on Markov chains, to correct GNSS traces of NoiseCapture data. Developing a
                        python package will make easier the integration of this tool into Noise-Planet's chain process. For better performance this algorithm will have to integrate a buffer zone in
                        order to avoid projections that are too far away.

                        The tracks corrected from the Markov chain algorithm hosted on a server of the Environmental Acoustics Research Unit, could thus be aggregated both in the form of hexagons and
                        road sections. In the second case, the data is aggregated to the road and not the pedestrian network to improve map reading and robustness.

                    <p>
                        currently, NoisePlanet uses a
                        <span class="color-orange">hexagonal grid</span> to display their raw data. This choice is justified by its form, as a regular hexagon is a unit mesh that can easily fill a
                        map. In addition, the 15m sides used by Noise-Planet correspond to a homogeneous acoustic level area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The aggregation solution currently offered by the Noise-Planet team could be confronted with an alternative offering combinations of visual variables more readable and
                        generalized to lower scales.

                    <h3>Uncertainty and precision</h3>
                    <p>
                        The use of
                        <span class="color-orange">road segment</span> allows to aggregate a larger number of measures on the same spatial entity. This number can be represented in associating a size
                        proportional to a symbol i.e. a line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The pros and cons of these two levels of aggregation have yet to be developed at the statistical level. Finally, the effectiveness of proposals incorporating cross
                        representations should be measured, including through a survey.
