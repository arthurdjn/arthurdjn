## hei, I'm arthurdjn üçÅ

Hello world! I'm Arthur Dujardin, a **deep learning engineer** specialized in computer vision based in Paris, FR.
I enjoy experimenting from latest research papers and designing engaging and creative AI applications.

I am interested in computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and generative models applied to
healthcare, space or arts. 
I contribute to open source projects or sometimes I build my own during my free time.
